                  Hey there! My name is Ike, also known as ikeman. As a Glitch
                  Vtuber, I love to bring a unique and innovative twist to my
                  content. I enjoy exploring various games, ranging from intense
                  first-person shooters like Apex Legends and Overwatch, to
                  survival games like Subnautica and Oxygen Not Included.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a streamer, I strive to provide an engaging and
                  entertaining experience for my audience, filled with laughter,
                  fun, and exciting gameplay. I am always on the lookout for new
                  games to try out and share with my community, as well as
                  exploring new ways to connect with my viewers and create a
                  welcoming and inclusive space.
